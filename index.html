        <h2 class="section-header">Introduction</h2>
        <h4 class="sub-section-header" id="who"><b> 1.1 Who is a drop-out?</b></h4>
    
            <p>A high school drop-out is a person who does not have a high school diploma and is not enrolled in school. 
            Usually, people aged 20-24 are considered in the calculations of dropout rates in Canada. 
            However, according to a report published by Statistics Canada, “almost all individuals who finish high school have likely done so by the age of 25” 
            <a href="#ref1" class="reference-link">[1]</a>
            . Therefore, on this website, drop-outs will be referred to as individuals aged 25 or older who do not have a high school diploma.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-section-header" id="BC"><b> 1.2 Dropout in BC</b></h4>
            <figure class="text-center">

                <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Figure 1. Dropouts in BC <a href="#ref1" class="reference-link">[2] </a> </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Figure 1 illustrates the dropout rate in BC in the years 2018-2022. 
                The chart demonstrates a positive, declining trend in dropout rates. 
                In fact, the dropout rate in 2022 was only 5 percent. 
                , high school dropout might be seen as an insignificant issue in BC. 
                However, given the fact that nearly 3 million people lived in BC in 2022 (citation), this 5 percent represents almost 150,000 people.

    <section id="cost">
        <h2 class="section-header">The Cost of Quitting School</h2>
        <p>Reducing high school dropout rate in BC is essential because dropping out of high school entails negative individual and social consequences.

        <h4 class="sub-section-header" id="lower-earnings"><b> 2.1 Lower earnings</b></h4>
            <figure class="text-center">
                <img src="Excel_Bar_Chart_earnings_with_currency.png" alt="Placeholder Image" width="500" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block table-borderless">
                <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Figure 2. Annual Earnings of Canadians by Level of Education, 2021
                    <a href="#ref1" class="reference-link">[3] </a> </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>High school drop-outs are the lowest wage earners who live on the edge of, if not in, poverty. 
                In 2021, high school dropouts aged 25-64 earned on average CA$8280 less than those with only a high school diploma. 
                This gap increases to CA$35160 compared to workers with a bachelor’s degree and to CA$48560 compared to those with a master’s degree. 
                Therefore, by dropping out of high school, people deprive themselves of a higher earning potential and a better quality of life. 
            </p>

        <h4 class="sub-section-header" id="crime"><b> 2.2 Increased crime rate</b></h4>
        <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="Excel_Project_Pie_Chart_Crime.png" alt="Placeholder Image" width="600" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block table-borderless">
            <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Figure 3. Inmates in Federal Prisons of Canada by Level of Education, 2008-2013 <a href="#ref1" class="reference-link">[3] </a> </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>High school drop-outs are much more likely than graduates to live a life of crime. 
            As illustrated in Figure 3, 75% of inmates in Canada did not have a high school diploma. 
            By dropping out and turning to crime, people not only fail to fulfill their human potential, but also cause harm to their communities.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-section-header" id="economy"><b> 2.3 Damage to Canadian Economy</b></h4>
        <p>According to a 2008 report <a href="#ref2" class="reference-link">[4]</a> by Charity Intelligence Canada, every year that produces drop-outs costs Canada CA$5.5 billion through lost income, foregone taxes, and increased spending to address social problems. Today, this value represents CA$7.5 billion. The Canadian government could use this money to improve life standards of all Canadians through investments in healthcare, education, infrastructure, and more.   
        </p>

    </section id="reasons">
        <p>To this day, there is not a single comprehensive, long-term study that covers the reasons behind high school dropout in British Columbia specifically. 
            However, studies conducted outside of BC provide a valuable insight into the causes of dropout.
